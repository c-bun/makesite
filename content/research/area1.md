We are designing better bioluminescent imaging tools. Bioluminescent proteins have been harnessed to see cancer cells as they divide and metastasize, track commensal bacteria as they interact with a host, and measure important metabolites with point-of-care devices. Their sensitivity and ease of use has made them ubiquitous in molecular and cellular biology. We are developing new uses for bioluminescent enzymes via protein engineering and directed evolution.
