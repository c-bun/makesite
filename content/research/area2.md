Enzymes are complex machines that have evolved to carry out a single chemical reaction under sepcific conditions. The Rathbun lab leverages medium-throughput screening techniques, Next-generation sequencing, and computer modeling to engineer these molecular machines to carry out new tasks. Specifically, we are interested in engineering new modes of selectivity for these enzymes.
